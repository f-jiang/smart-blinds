   - which wifi mode?
       - sta mode
           - connect to network - but how?
           - write password into code
           - get password from external storage medium
           - wps connect
           - once connected can control blinds thru wifi network and sending of data packets with basic info
           - would be able to use any other device on network to control blinds, but pref phone with app
           - would it be possible to control from other networks? would need communication between networks
           - but then security becomes an issue
           - how do i communicate between networks?
       - ap mode
           - phone connects to blinds - simpler and would work but then phone loses internet cxn
           - things the blinds needs to do
           - remember its current position
           - remember its open and closed position
           - move blinds stepper motor between open and closed positions
           - switch stepper motor on and off using relay
           - listen to commands via wifi

   - calibration: reset open and closed positiosn
   - move between open and close positions
   - manual adjustment
   - move position via buttons

   - we want blinds to work without phone, so store all position data on blinds and make phone get position data from blinds each time rather than storing it itself
